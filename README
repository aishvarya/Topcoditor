Installation:

1) Install the Google Chrome extension: Download and open the file topcoditor.crx using Google Chrome or drag and drop it into a Google Chrome window.

2) Download template.cpp and systemplate.cpp to convenient locations.

3) In Google Chrome, go to Wrench Icon -> Tools -> Extensions -> Topcoditor Options. There you must enter the directory you want Topcoditor to save files in, and the locations of the Solution Template (that would be the path you saved template.cpp to) and the System Tests Template (likewise for systemplate.cpp).

Customization:

You can edit the sample template file to create your own customized templates. The template file uses some tags to denote problem specific data such as class-name, method-name etc. Wherever these tags are found, they are replaced with the problem specific appropriate value. Most of the tags should be pretty self-explanatory. Some of them are: <%class-name%>, <%return-type%>, <%method-name%>.

The parameters tag is a bit more involved. The general form is <%parameter:pattern:separator%> where pattern and separator are user-defined strings. This says that, the parameters would be listed (in the order given in the problem statement), separated by the string 'separator'. Each parameter has the form of pattern, where every occurrence of $0 in it is replaced by the parameter type, and $1 is replaced by the parameter identifier.

For example: <%parameters:$0 $1:, %> would output a string like "type1 param1, type2 param2, type3 param3". 

And the tag:
<%parameters:$0 $1:;
%>;

would output the parameters like:
type1 param1;
type2 param2;
type3 param3;

The example-tests tag is similar. The general format is: <%example-tests:patt-params:sep-params:gap:patt-exp:sep%>
For each test case:
    The parameters are printed out using patt-params (only $0 is used) separated by sep-params.
    This is followed by gap.
    Next, the expected output is printed out using patt-exp.
The test cases are separated by sep.

The system-tests tag has the exact same syntax as example-tests.
